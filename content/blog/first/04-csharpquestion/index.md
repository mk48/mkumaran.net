#### increment and decrement operators are done differently in C# and C

One thing that you have to remember is, the way C# does it is different than how C does it. Many people reason as though C# and C are the same language; they are not.

[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3346450/what-is-the-difference-between-i-and-i/3346729#3346729) is the great explanation about c# pre and post increment operators.

#### Explanation

```csharp
int x = 5;
x += x++ + ++x;
```

##### Step 0

```csharp
x += x++ + ++x;
```

##### Step 1

```csharp
x = x + (x++) + (++x);
```

##### Step 2

```csharp
x = 5 + (x++) + (++x);
```

##### Step 3

```csharp
x = 5 + 5 + (++x);
```

step #3 is very important. x++ result is 5, but the variable ‘x’ value has been incremented to 6. so the next ‘x’ value is 6. Read this link for more explanation.

##### Step 4

```csharp
x = 5 + 5 + (++6)
= 5 + 5 + 7
= 17
```

so answer for **int x=5; x += x++ + ++x; is 17**
