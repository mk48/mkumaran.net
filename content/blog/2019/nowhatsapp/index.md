### WhatsApp and others are collecting Metadata

> Are your readers having trouble understanding the term "metadata"? Replace it with "activity records." That's what they are.

### WhatsApp saying that

We can’t listen/read the content of your communication because we use end-to-end encryption, we can only collect metadata.

[Don't be fooled: Metadata is the real data](https://standardnotes.org/blog/4/don-t-be-fooled-metadata-is-the-real-data)

#### Some example of meta data collection:

1. They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.
2. They know you spoke with an HIV testing service, then your doctor, then your health insurance company in the same hour. But they don’t know what was discussed.

Now that you know what metadata is, let me reiterate: using end-to-end encryption does not prevent messaging services from collecting metadata.

#### WhatsApp’s FAQ states that

WhatsApp has access to all the phone numbers in your address book, and that it collects a myriad of information about you.

### Use Signal messenger instead of WhatsApp

[Signal in Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)

By the way, Signal code is free and open-source, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/whispersystems) for you to check.

You might be tempted to say something like:
Who cares? I have nothing to hide.

If you don’t think privacy is all that important:
