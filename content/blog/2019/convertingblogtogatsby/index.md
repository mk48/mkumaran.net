title: Converting my blog to Gatsby
date: '2019-01-18'

I had my blog on wordpress.
i moved to js
update to js blog
i selected gatsby

before i took backup of wordpress db and simple copy paste of every blog into a word document.
i didn't write many blogs, so copy paste into word was a simple one.

i tried to pandoc to convert my word document to md formate, but that didn't help much.
